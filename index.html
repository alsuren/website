            <p>Human beings depend on each other, but this dependence should not result in oppression. We believe technology should be governed by us all and enhance our collective autonomy.</p>

            <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">Experimentation</h3>

            <p>Effective Altruism asks how we solve the world’s problems & pairs this with a theory of change: start by doing the most effective good you can. Effective Radicalism suggests that the best we can do, might be to consider changing systemic conditions.</p>

              <p class="py2">A collaborative community-based project that offers alternative systems for addressing harm in our communities. The Alternative Justices Project seeks to further the research, creation, and application of systems of justice that can transcend and transform the state and its flawed systems of law and justice. Together we are building a web app that allows those who experienced harm to inform a steward, while safeguarding their privacy.</p>

To this end the Social Observatory is a shared resource for the scientific community, for the study of human social behaviour. We are equally interested in studying how humans behave in social settings, and how humans could behave if they were nudged. </p>
