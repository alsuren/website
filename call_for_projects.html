      <h3 class="py2 px3 mb2">Type of projects</h3>
        <p class="py2 px3 mb2">Radical Engineers supports organisations and projects with radical aims.
          <br><br>
          By radical we mean system-changing:  faced with the threat of mass extinction, a warming globe and rising inequality, we cannot afford to merely fight symptoms, but have to instead radically rethink the economic and social systems that produce them.
          <br><br>
        For instance, in addition to removing waste from the oceans, how can we ensure waste never reaches our oceans in the first place?  If you’re working on system-changing projects and are looking for technical support (in the broadest sense of the term), then we may be able to help!</p>
      <h3 class="py2 px3 mb2">All sizes are welcome</h3>
        <p class="py2 px3 mb2">We support organisations of all sizes, experience levels and types (e.g. NGO, charities, corporations).</p>

      <h3 class="py2 px3 mb2">We are London-based, but you don’t have to be</h3>
        <p class="py2 px3 mb2">If your organisation supports remote work, then so do we!</p>
